User Table:\n    * Columns:\n\n        * id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.\n        * username: User's username.\n        * email: User's email address.\n    * Reasoning:\n\n        * id is a common practice for a primary key, ensuring a unique identifier for each user.\n        * username stores the user's chosen name, and email stores their email address.\n**Why this structure** :\n1. Separate User Information:\n\n    * Storing user information in a separate table (users) allows for a clear and organized representation of user data.\n2. Normalization:\n\n    * The structure follows the principles of database normalization by avoiding redundancy. Each piece of data is stored in one place (e.g., username and email are not duplicated).\n3. Scalability:\n\n    * The structure is scalable. If you need to add more information about users in the future (e.g., profile picture, date of birth), you can easily extend the users table without modifying existing data.\n4. Primary Key:\n\n    * The id column serves as a primary key, providing a unique identifier for each user. This is useful for referencing users in other tables (e.g., in a separate table for user-related activities).\n5. Email Validation:\n\n    * The email column is included, and i've implemented an email_check function to validate email addresses. This ensures data integrity and helps prevent the storage of invalid email addresses.\n6. Flexibility:\n\n    * The structure allows for flexibility in handling different user-related operations, such as insertion, updating, and deleting users.","metadata":{}}]}
